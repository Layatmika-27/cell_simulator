# 🧫 Cell Simulator

An interactive biological-style cell simulator built with **Pygame**. Watch cells move, seek food, reproduce, and die in a dynamic environment. This simulation combines fun visuals with a simple educational take on energy-based life forms.

## Features ✨

- **Autonomous Cells:** Cells move randomly but steer toward nearby food sources.
- **Energy Mechanics:** Cells gain energy from food, lose energy over time, and can die if energy depletes.
- **Reproduction:** Cells split when they have sufficient energy.
- **Visual Effects:** Smooth glowing cells with subtle "breathing" animation.
- **Food Mechanics:** 
  - Spawn food by clicking or pressing `F`.
  - Optional timed auto food spawn (commented out for manual control).
- **HUD & Stats:** Track population, births, food count, speed, and pause state.
- **Interactive Controls:** Easily manipulate the simulation in real-time.
